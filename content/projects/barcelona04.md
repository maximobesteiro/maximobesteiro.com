---

Responsible for the analysis, design and subsequent implementation of web applications at their offices in Buenos Aires.
Having started as a junior developer in charge of the maintenance of the desktop application _DataMonitor for SQL Server_ (a data-level auditing tool) I quickly started contributing in several projects such as:

- the development of web applications like _Reports_ and _Dashboards_
- the development of the company's own web framework and UI components
- planning sessions for a long-term project that would span for over an year

At Barcelona/04 I learned to work with a strict _Scrum_ methodology, where we went from grooming sessions, poker planning, sprints execution with daily standups by the board and retrospective meetings at the end of each sprint. Through time, the team speed benefited from the use of this Agile methodology.
