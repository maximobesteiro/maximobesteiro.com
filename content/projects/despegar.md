At Despegar, I had the opportunity to lead different teams towards:

- the implementation of the web mobile version of the site, focusing on performance and usage of a dedicated mobile API
- maintaining several internal tools to assist mobile development (mainly a configuration service and the push notifications service)
- building a custom front end (Angular + Material UI) for managing push notifications
- migrating the data model for mobile customers (from PostgreSQL to MongoDB)
