I joined the company initially as an IC, in charge of the UI team in the game "Minifazenda". Responsible for the maintenance and improvement of the user interface as well as the integration with social networks (Facebook and Orkut API). Estimation, planning and coordination of general development tasks in the game. Design integration strategies between the client application (developed in Flash), the back-end and the user interface (developed in Javascript, HTML and CSS).
