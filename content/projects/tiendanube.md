As a Engineering Manager I focused in putting the team into a growth mindset and improving deliverability.
The team was in charge of the paymentâ€™s domain. We worked following ShapeUp methodology (by BaseCamp) in an attempt to define focused projects and increase collaboration and engagement within the team.
