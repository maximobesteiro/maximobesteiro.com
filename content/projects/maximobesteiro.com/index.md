I designed my portfolio with a focus on simplicity and clarity. The process began with thorough research, followed by design exploration in Figma, which allowed me to quickly visualize my ideas. Feel free to get the Figma file [here](maximobesteiro.com.fig).

For development, I chose React with TypeScript for structure and maintainability. TailwindCSS streamlined my styling workflow, and Next.js provided robust navigation, routing, and server-side rendering.

If you are enjoying the experience and want to poke around, feel free to check out the GitHub repository.
